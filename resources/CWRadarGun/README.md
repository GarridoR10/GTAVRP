# MPH / KPH
Thanks to JebstaLP from the FiveM forums for this contribution.<br>
Set line 23:
- true = KPH (metric)
- false = MPH (imperial)

# Intended Purpose
To provide a radar gun that works outside of a vehicle.

# Features
- Radar is front only
- Can be used in or out of the vehicle
- Picks up players and NPC's
- Freeze plate
- Frozen plate stays up when getting in or out of a vehicle to compare with the vehicle you pull over

# Issues
- Will pick up your vehicle when using radar outside of it
- Need to change the freeze key because of controller conflict on left bumper (edit on line 57)
